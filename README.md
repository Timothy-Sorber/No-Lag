# No-Lag
Clears all ground items in your minecraft server every 120 seconds.

Just put it in the scripts folder of the skript folder in your minecraft server.
(You need skript for this to work at all)
after putting the NoLag skript in do this command:
/sk reload Nolag.sk
or:
/sk reload [filename here].sk (if you changed the files name)
